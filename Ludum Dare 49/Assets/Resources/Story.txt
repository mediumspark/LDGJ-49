A long time ago, the forest was at balance with the forces of nature.
As time passed and life evolved things began to slowly change. Life began to take the world for granted. It wasn't long before life rose from the forest and established cities.
The people of the city forgot of the forest and began to misue her resources to power their great cities.
These activities upset the natural cycle of the forest and triggered more and more fires each year. Now your family's and friend's home is in peril.
Little do the creatures of the city know that if the forest falls they fall too.You must reach the leaders and  stop them before too much damage is done.
Beware! they will try and stop you, but you must prevail.
